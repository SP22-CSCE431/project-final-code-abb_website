## Deployment ##
<<<<<<< HEAD
To deploy your app to Heroku, use the git push command to push the code from your local repositoryâ€™s main branch to your heroku remote. 
Use this same command whenever you want to deploy the latest committed version of your code to Heroku.

Heroku only deploys code that you push to the master or main branches of the remote. Pushing code to another branch of the heroku remote has no effect.
=======

Setup a Heroku account: https://signup.heroku.com/

From the heroku dashboard select `New` -> `Create New Pipline`

Name the pipeline, and link the respective git repo to the pipline

Our application does not need any extra options, so select `Enable Review Apps` right away

Click `New app` under review apps, and link your test branch from your repo

Under staging app, select `Create new app` and link your main branch from your repo
